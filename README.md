# Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using Python.

## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for anyone interested in computer science or programming in general. This repository aims to provide clear implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Python, along with explanations and examples to aid comprehension.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees
   - Graphs
   - Hash Tables
   - Heaps
   - ... (more to be added)

2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
   - Dynamic Programming Algorithms
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - ... (more to be added)

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. To use them:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired data structure or algorithm file.
3. Run the Python file using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python3 filename.py`).

Feel free to modify the implementations or use them as a reference for your projects. Comments and contributions are welcome!
