## Why learn DSA?
Learning DSA is essential for any programmer who wants to improve their problem-solving skills, write efficient code, and increase their chances of getting placed in top companies.

## Importance of structuring data
Structuring data efficiently allows for faster access and manipulation. It reduces time and space complexity in algorithms, making code more efficient.

## What is a data structure?
A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer for efficient use.

## Classification of data structures
Data structures can be linear or non-linear:
- **Linear data structures:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.
- **Non-Linear data structures:** Trees, graphs, etc.

## Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step logical representations to solve problems efficiently.

## Prerequisites
To start with DSA using Python, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python
- Knowledge of built-in types, control statements, functions, classes and objects
